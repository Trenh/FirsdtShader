My own shader is the kaleidoscope Shader

You can change the texture on the material for Differrents effect
It work really well with the "red aestetichs","kaleido" and "tentacle"

Div Time is the invert of the speed
Sections is the number of sectionswho will occur on the plane
and nb Sprites is the number of sprite which will occur on the sections
